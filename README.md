# travel_company_analysis
I am an analyst at a company that specializes in monetizing Travel content. Some users of this company's products may place affiliate links in their blogs or articles. If a ticket is purchased through this affiliate link, the user and the company receive a fixed percentage of the purchase amount.

From January 1 to April 2, 2023 (92 days) a marketing campaign was organized for the company's clients. During the campaign, prizes were raffled off among users. The winners were the 10 people who made the most reservations during the promotion.
It was expected that this promotion would help to reactivate old users and motivate new clients to use affiliate links more actively. As a result, the total Revenue (the sum of all affiliates during the promotion) was supposed to increase.
My task as an analyst of this company is to answer the question whether the promotion was successful and whether the goal of increasing the total Revenue was achieved?
